# ðŸ§  Competitive-Coding

This repository is a collection of coding problems Iâ€™ve solved so far, sourced from platforms like **LeetCode**, **CodeForces** and **GeeksforGeeks**. It serves as a personal archive to track progress and revisit concepts when needed.

## ðŸ”¹ LeetCode

One of the most popular platforms for interview prep and algorithmic practice.  
Questions are organized into three difficulty-based folders:

- `Easy/`
- `Medium/`
- `Hard/`

Each file contains a single problem solution, typically written in Python or Java.

## ðŸ”¹ CodeForces

Competitive programming problems from Codeforces, categorized using the standard difficulty rating.

- **File naming format:** `difficultyQuestionName.py`  
  **Example:** `800ThreeBrothers.py` represents a problem rated 800 titled *Three Brothers*.

## ðŸ”¹ GeeksforGeeks

Contains solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks.  
Thereâ€™s no strict categorization here â€” each file is named after the problem it addresses.


## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This repository is a **work in progress** and will continue to grow with solutions from more platforms.
- Most problems are solved in **Python** with occasional use of other languages.
