682. Baseball Game

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.
You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record 
and is one of the following:

An integer x => Record a new score of x.
'+' => Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D' => Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C' => Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

Example 1:

Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
